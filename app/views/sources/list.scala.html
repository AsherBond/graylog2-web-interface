        This is a list of all sources that sent in messages to Graylog2. Use it to quickly search for all
        messages of a specific source or get an overview of what systems are sending in how many messages.

        <strong>
            Click on source name to prepare a query for it. Hold the Alt key while clicking to search right
            away.
        </strong>

        Note that the list is cached for a few seconds so you might have to wait a bit until a new source
        appears.
